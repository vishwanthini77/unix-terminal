## What Makes Unix Important?

Unix powers the internet. Most servers, cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), and development environments run Unix or Linux (a Unix variant).

**When you understand Unix, you can**:
- Debug production issues by reading logs
- Understand deployment processes
- Communicate precisely with engineers
- Navigate server environments confidently
- Make better technical decisions

**You don't need to be an expert** - just knowing the basics dramatically improves your effectiveness when working with technical teams.

## Course Philosophy

**Zero friction**: No downloads, no configuration, no barriers. Just learn.

**Practical focus**: Every command and concept is taught with real-world scenarios you'll actually encounter.

**Safe environment**: You can't break anything here. Experiment freely. Make mistakes. Learn by doing.

## Terminal Basics

The terminal accepts text commands. Here are a few to get started:
```bash
help            # See all available commands
clear           # Clear the screen
pwd             # Show current directory
ls              # List files
```

**Try typing `help` in the terminal right now** to see all available commands organized by category.
